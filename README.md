- 👋 Hi, I’m Tanay Garg
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, filmaking and mindless pondering about our existence ......
- 🌱 My Coursework includes Data Structures, Computer Architecture, and Linear Algebra. These classes have given me a solid foundation in developing efficient software using languages like Java, C, C#, and Python. My Linear Algebra class and personal projects involving CV have also taught me a lot about Machine Learning and specifically concepts like Back propagation in Neural Networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Full stack projects. Throughout my past projects I have used a variety of tech stacks and gotten familiar with techonoliges like React, Next-JS, Flask, Python, NodeJS, and SQL. 
- 📫 How to reach me: my emai is tanay.garg@utexas.edu or IG: @tanay_has_a_username
- I am also interested in ed-tech and education in general. I am currently employed as a teching assistant at the University of Texas at Austin, a top 10 CS program in the US.
