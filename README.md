- 👋 Hi, I’m Tanay Garg
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, filmmaking, and soccer ⚽.
- 🌱 My Coursework includes Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Probability and Linear Algebra. These classes have given me a solid foundation in developing efficient software using languages like Java, C, C#, and Python. My Linear Algebra class and personal projects involving CV have also taught me a lot about Machine Learning and specifically concepts like Neural Networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Full-stack projects. Throughout my past projects, I have used a variety of tech stacks and gotten familiar with technologies like React, Next-JS, Flask, Python, NodeJS, and SQL.
- ⭐ I am the President of ECLAIR, a Robotics and AI organization in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. One of my core beliefs is that education should be made accessible to every human being and this has been reflected in my involvement with the organization. I have created my own beginner-friendly curriculum within ECLAIR to allow new programmers and non-cs majors to pick up Software Development and Robotics within a single semester.
- 🤖 I am also a General Leader in IEEE Robotics Automation Society. As a part of their Robomasters team, I have been working on implementing LiDAR detection in the past few years along with developing an Object Log data structure that keeps track of enemies detected by onboard CV. This data structure houses multiple functions that implement a Kalman filter to detect depth and trajectory, handling all vector calculations using CUDA cores on the GPU onboard.  
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is tanay.garg@utexas.edu or IG: @tanay_has_a_username
- I am also interested in ed-tech and education in general. I am currently employed as a teaching assistant at the University of Texas at Austin, a top 10 CS program in the US.
